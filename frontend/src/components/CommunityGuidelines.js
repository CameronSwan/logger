                    Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here â€” and each of 
                    us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether 
                    blatant or via micro-aggressions. All forms of communication should not demean others. Consider what you are 
                    saying and how it would feel if it were said to you, or about you. <br/>

                    <h3>Speak up if you see or hear something. </h3>
                    Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. 
                    The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their 
                    behavior to their attention is encouraged. <br/>
